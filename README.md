# Gilded Rose Coding Kata

This is a modified version of the Gilded Rose Kata, to use in CS 482 - Software Engineering at Loyola University Maryland by Prof. H. Rocha.

Please do send me a pull request with your solution. Although I wont accept it, it is the easier way to evaluate your work in this kata.

## How to Use this Kata

This Kata is divided into two parts: Testing & Refactoring. We will tackle each on the appropriate lecture.

Clone this repo to your Git or locally as a zip, and let's start the **fun**.

## Testing Kata

The code for Gilded Rose is very messy. First, we need to write tests for it.

You should use the ["Gilded Rose Requirements"](GildedRoseRequirements.txt) which explains what this code is suppose to do. Write at least one test for each requirement. 

Do not touch the Guilded Rose code in this Kata. Your only objective here is to write tests. After you have a nice test suite, then you can attempt the next Kata and refactor the code.

## Refactoring Kata

After finishing writing tests for all the  requirements and making sure they are green, now it is time add code to support the new feature on conjured items.

As you can see, the code is very messy. Therefore, before adding a new feature, lets refactor the code first. Use the ["Gilded Rose Requirements"](GildedRoseRequirements.txt) as a guide to your code and your tests to make sure you are not breaking anything.
